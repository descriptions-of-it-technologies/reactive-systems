## Reactive Manifesto.
* Responsive
    * The system responds in a timely manner.
    * Responsiveness is the cornerstone of usability and utility.
    * Responsiveness also means problems may be detected quickly and dealt with effectively.
    * Responsive systems provide rapid and consistent response times.
    * Consistent behavior simplifies error handling, builds end user confidence, and encourages further interaction.
* Resilient
    * System stays responsive in the face of failure.
    * Resilience is achieved by replication, containment, isolation, and delegation.
    * Failures are contained within each component.
    * Parts of the system can fail, without compromising the system as a whole.
    * Recovery of each component is delegated to another.
    * High-availability is ensured by replication where necessary.
* Elastic
    * The system stays responsive under varying workload.
    * Reactive Systems can react to changes in the input rate by increasing or decreasing resources allocated to service inputs.
    * Reactive Systems achieve elasticity in a cost effective way on commodity hardware and software platforms.
* Message-driven.
    * Reactive Systems rely on asynchronous message passing to establish a boundary between components.
    * This ensures loose coupling, isolation, and location transparency.
    * Message passing enables load management, elasticity, and flow control.
    * Location transparent messaging makes management of failures possible
    * Non-blocking communication allows recipients to only consume resources while active, leading to less system overhead.





## 
* A reactive system is both scalable and resilient, producing responses with consistent latencies despite demanding workloads and failures.
* Dependable applications that are message-driven, resilient, elastic, and responsive.
